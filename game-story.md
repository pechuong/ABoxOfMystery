        It's strange in that when you wipe the dust off, it looks more futuristic than old.

        A light highlights the edges of the box from where you pressed.
        You feel your soul and body being pulled...
        The box teleports your entire self inside to what appears to be a dark place or rather..
            - a dark room :^)
        Here you see texts glow but nothing else..
        They instruct you in different ways.
